	<h2>PUT ANOTHER SUB TITLE HERE</h2>
	<p class="content">On the other hand, I found that the gameplay was a little on the easy 
	side. Sure, I could have played the game on hard mode, but I feel that the 
	normal mode should have provided more of a challenge because it was 
	generally quite easy to get through. The greatest difficulty in Bioshock 
	was having enough ammo to get by, often I ran out but that may be because 
	I'm a bad shot. They really improved the ammo management in the second 
	game however, which was great. Also, the ending was a little anticlimatic, 
	I was expecting some sort of big interactive ending that really went out 
	with a bang, but there was just a little narrative at the end. The ending 
	was good, but it could have been much better.</p>
