	<h2>PUT SUB TITLE HERE</h2>
	<p class="content">Bioshock is a first person shooter that only allows for single player. 
	This game really takes you for a ride though because you feel like shooting 
	things is only the means to a greater end. You do not kill because you want 
	to, you kill because you have to in order to progress in the story. Because 
	the game puts such a heavy emphasis on taking the player on an adventure 
	where everything is out to kill you, it achieves a perfect balance between 
	action and narrative.</p>
	<p class="content">The story itself is the stuff of legend. You never know and cannot 
	expect what will unfold next and it leaves you wondering what lies behind 
	the next corner. After you've went around that corner though, you're left 
	basking in the ingenuity of what just happened. On top of that surreal 
	story-telling it doesn't feel at all forced, but the narrative progresses 
	at a very natural pace.</p>
	<p class="content">The game mechanics are also a wonderful aspect of the game. The 
	controls never feel awkward, but rather natural. You have enough combat 
	options to go through the game guns blazing, or you can burn, shock and 
	whack things to death. There is also an aspect of moral choice in the game, 
	which really changes how fast you can grow stronger and what people say 
	about you. </p>
