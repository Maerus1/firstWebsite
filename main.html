	<h1>PUT INTRO TITLE HERE</h1>
	<p class="content">I recently played through Bioshock from 2K Games, 
	Feral Interactive and Irrational Games on the PC, and I can honestly say 
	that it was a wonderful experience all the way through. Even though it 
	is a fantastic game, this definitely is not a game for kids due to its 
	mature rating with ESRB. Overall, Bioshock had wonderful balance, a great 
	story and fantastic game mechanics.</p>
	<h2>PUT SUB TITLE HERE</h2>
	<p class="content">Bioshock is a first person shooter that only allows for single player. 
	This game really takes you for a ride though because you feel like shooting 
	things is only the means to a greater end. You do not kill because you want 
	to, you kill because you have to in order to progress in the story. Because 
	the game puts such a heavy emphasis on taking the player on an adventure 
	where everything is out to kill you, it achieves a perfect balance between 
	action and narrative.</p>
	<p class="content">The story itself is the stuff of legend. You never know and cannot 
	expect what will unfold next and it leaves you wondering what lies behind 
	the next corner. After you've went around that corner though, you're left 
	basking in the ingenuity of what just happened. On top of that surreal 
	story-telling it doesn't feel at all forced, but the narrative progresses 
	at a very natural pace.</p>
	<p class="content">The game mechanics are also a wonderful aspect of the game. The 
	controls never feel awkward, but rather natural. You have enough combat 
	options to go through the game guns blazing, or you can burn, shock and 
	whack things to death. There is also an aspect of moral choice in the game, 
	which really changes how fast you can grow stronger and what people say 
	about you. </p>
	<h2>PUT ANOTHER SUB TITLE HERE</h2>
	<p class="content">On the other hand, I found that the gameplay was a little on the easy 
	side. Sure, I could have played the game on hard mode, but I feel that the 
	normal mode should have provided more of a challenge because it was 
	generally quite easy to get through. The greatest difficulty in Bioshock 
	was having enough ammo to get by, often I ran out but that may be because 
	I'm a bad shot. They really improved the ammo management in the second 
	game however, which was great. Also, the ending was a little anticlimatic, 
	I was expecting some sort of big interactive ending that really went out 
	with a bang, but there was just a little narrative at the end. The ending 
	was good, but it could have been much better.</p>
	<h2>The Final Verdict:</h2>
	<p class="content">In general, with everything about the game in mind, I would give 
	Bioshock an overwhelming 10 out of 10. It was truly a fanstastic 
	experience.</p>
